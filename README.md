Store password in Converted Ascii form, to avoid storing password in plain text

This is a simple fuction made for my assignment, it is nowhere as secure as real encryption. This is only a way to store password in a bit safer way.

How it works: string input of password is changed to ascii then manipulated((add/sub) other ascii value) to be stored in a different character. The converted form of password can then be changed back to the normal(real) form.
